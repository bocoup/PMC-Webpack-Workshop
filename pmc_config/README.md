# PMC's Webpack Config

This file should be familiar to you, as it was taken from the PMC-Core theme.

In this exercise, we'd like to walk through this config and identify what we learned previously in the workshop. Please ask questions as we go.

The goal of walking through this config is to show that despite it looking intimidating and complex, it's not much different from a simple config that we created during the workshop exercise.
